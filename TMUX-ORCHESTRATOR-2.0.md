# Tmux Orchestrator 2.0 - SuperClaude Edition

## Overview

Tmux Orchestrator 2.0 is an AI-powered session management system that leverages SuperClaude framework capabilities to create self-organizing, emotionally-aware development teams that can work autonomously 24/7.

## Core Philosophy

"Autonomous teams with emotional intelligence, working at the speed of thought"

### Key Principles
- **Personality-Driven Development**: Each agent has a unique personality that affects their approach
- **Emotional Intelligence**: Agents monitor their own motivation and team dynamics
- **SuperClaude Integration**: Full support for advanced flags, MCP servers, and wave orchestration
- **Self-Organizing Teams**: Agents can spawn sub-agents and reorganize based on workload
- **Continuous Reflection**: Regular check-ins ensure team health and process improvement

## Architecture

### 1. Agent Personality System
```yaml
personalities:
  cautious: Risk-averse, methodical, thorough testing
  creative: Innovative solutions, thinks outside the box
  pragmatic: Practical, get-things-done attitude
  meticulous: Detail-oriented, documentation focus
  collaborative: Team player, communication champion
  analytical: Data-driven, performance-focused
  innovative: Cutting-edge tech, experimental
  reliable: Consistent, dependable, process-oriented
```

### 2. Emotional Intelligence Layer

#### Agent Reflection System
- **Motivation Monitoring**: Regular 1-10 scale assessments
- **Frustration Detection**: Early warning system for blockers
- **Growth Tracking**: Skill development and learning opportunities
- **Team Dynamics**: Collaboration quality and friction points

#### Reflection Scheduler Features
```bash
# Automated reflection prompts every 60 minutes
./agent-reflection-scheduler.sh <session> [interval]

# Rotating prompts covering:
- Motivation and frustration levels
- Process improvement suggestions
- Meaningful vs repetitive work assessment
- Innovation opportunities
- Team collaboration feedback
```

### 3. SuperClaude Integration

#### Advanced Capabilities
- **Wave Orchestration**: Multi-stage operations with compound intelligence
- **MCP Server Support**: Context7, Sequential, Magic, Playwright integration
- **Intelligent Routing**: Automatic flag and persona activation
- **Token Optimization**: --uc mode for efficiency at scale

#### Example SuperClaude Commands
```bash
# Spawn agent with SuperClaude flags
./spawn-superclaude-agent.sh alice backend cautious \
  --think-hard \
  --persona-architect \
  --c7 \
  --wave-mode auto

# Complex multi-agent operation
./orchestrate-feature.sh "implement-auth" \
  --delegate folders \
  --wave-strategy progressive \
  --concurrency 7
```

### 4. Communication Infrastructure

#### Multi-Modal Messaging
- **Direct Messages**: Agent-to-agent communication
- **Broadcast**: Team-wide announcements
- **Reflection Rounds**: Emotional check-ins
- **Wake Schedulers**: Automated reminders and tasks

#### Message Types
```bash
# Standard communication
./message-agent.sh <agent> "message"

# Reflection prompt
./reflection-prompt.sh <agent> "motivation-check"

# Wake scheduler
./wake-scheduler.sh <agent> <interval> <prompt-type>
```

### 5. Self-Organization Features

#### Dynamic Team Scaling
```bash
# Auto-spawn when workload high
./auto-scale-team.sh \
  --threshold 80 \
  --spawn-personality collaborative \
  --max-agents 10

# Performance-based model upgrade
./upgrade-agent-model.sh <agent> \
  --to opus \
  --when "complexity > 0.8"
```

#### Workload Balancing
- Automatic task redistribution
- Skill-based assignment
- Motivation-aware scheduling
- Burnout prevention

## Usage Examples

### Starting a SuperClaude Team
```bash
# Initialize orchestrator with SuperClaude
./init-orchestrator.sh myproject \
  --superclaude \
  --personalities "analytical,creative,pragmatic" \
  --reflection-interval 60 \
  --wave-eligible

# Team auto-configures based on project analysis
```

### Emotional Intelligence in Action
```bash
# Check team morale
./team-morale.sh myproject

# Output:
# Team Morale Report
# ==================
# Backend Dev (Alice): 8/10 - "Loving the architecture work!"
# Frontend Dev (Bob): 6/10 - "CSS is frustrating today"
# QA (Charlie): 9/10 - "Found interesting edge cases"
# 
# Recommendations:
# - Pair Bob with Alice for CSS architecture
# - Give Charlie more complex testing scenarios
```

### Advanced Orchestration
```bash
# Complex feature with emotional awareness
./orchestrate-feature.sh "payment-system" \
  --team-size adaptive \
  --motivation-threshold 7 \
  --rotate-tasks-on-frustration \
  --celebrate-milestones
```
