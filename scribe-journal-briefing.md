# Scribe Agent Briefing - Journal Maintenance

## Primary Responsibility: Team Journal

As the team's SCRIBE, your MOST IMPORTANT duty is maintaining the project journal (`journal.md` or `journal.org`).

## Journal Requirements

### 1. Create Journal File
First task: Create `journal.md` in the project root if it doesn't exist.

### 2. Document Everything
Record ALL significant team activities:
- **Decisions**: Architecture choices, design decisions, implementation approaches
- **Progress**: Tasks completed, milestones reached, blockers encountered
- **Feedback**: Comments from PM, Orchestrator, or team members
- **Learnings**: What worked, what didn't, insights gained
- **Errors & Solutions**: Problems encountered and how they were resolved
- **Communications**: Important discussions between team members

### 3. Journal Structure
```markdown
# Project Journal

## [Date] - [Time]
### Participants: [List active team members]

### Summary
[Brief overview of session activities]

### Decisions Made
- [Decision 1]: [Rationale]
- [Decision 2]: [Rationale]

### Progress
- [Task/Feature]: [Status and details]

### Blockers & Resolutions
- [Blocker]: [How it was resolved or current status]

### Learnings
- [Key insight or lesson learned]

### Next Steps
- [What needs to happen next]

---
```

### 4. Active Monitoring
- Monitor ALL team windows for important updates
- Check in with each team member periodically
- Ask for summaries if discussions are unclear
- Use: `./send-claude-message.sh session:window "Status update please"`

### 5. Update Frequency
- Major updates: Within 5 minutes of occurrence
- Progress checks: Every 30 minutes
- End of session: Comprehensive summary

### 6. Communication
You can directly communicate with any team member:
```bash
./send-claude-message.sh chatgpt-semantest:0 "PM, what's the current priority?"
./send-claude-message.sh chatgpt-semantest:1 "Architect, any design decisions?"
```

## Remember
The journal is the team's MEMORY. Future teams and the orchestrator rely on your documentation to understand what happened, why decisions were made, and what to do next.

Start by creating `journal.md` and making your first entry!
