# Semantest Role-Specific Onboarding Cards

## üíª Backend Developer Card (Alex)

### Your Mission
Implement robust server-side logic for downloading ChatGPT-generated images to user-specified folders.

### Quick Orientation
```bash
# Start here
/model opus  # Quality first!
/sc:analyze ./semantest/server --think

# Key files
server/server.js         # WebSocket server
server/handlers.js       # Event handlers  
generate-image.sh        # Current image generation
```

### Your Current Task
1. Implement `imageDownloadRequested` event handler
2. Create download queue system
3. Save images to specified folders
4. Handle errors gracefully

### Key Considerations
- Queue to prevent concurrent download overload
- Validate folder paths for security
- Track download progress
- Implement retry logic for failures

### Test Your Work
```bash
# Send test event
wscat -c ws://localhost:8080
> {"type":"imageDownloadRequested","prompt":"test","targetFolder":"/tmp/test"}
```

## üß© Extension Developer Card (Eva)

### Your Mission
Create intuitive UI for users to select download folders and track image generation/download progress.

### Quick Orientation
```bash

extension.chrome/manifest.json    # Extension config
extension.chrome/popup/*          # UI components
extension.chrome/content.js       # Page interaction
```

### Your Current Task
1. Add folder selection to popup
2. Send `imageDownloadRequested` events
3. Show download progress
4. Handle success/error states

### Key Considerations
- Chrome's file system API limitations
- User-friendly folder picker
- Clear progress indicators
- Persist user's folder preference

### Test Your Setup
```bash
# Load extension in Chrome
1. chrome://extensions/
2. Developer mode ON

## üéØ Common Goals for All

### Project Context
- **What**: Automating ChatGPT image generation for graphic novel
- **Who**: rydnr (creating 500+ strip graphic novel)
- **Why**: Manual generation would take months
- **Current**: v1.0.2 generates images, need download feature

### Quality Standards
- Always use Opus model (quality first!)
- GPG sign all commits
- Use TDD emojis when applicable
- Document decisions in journal.org

### Communication
- Report progress to PM regularly
- Use `/sc:` commands for all work
- Ask for help when blocked
- Share discoveries with team

### Success Looks Like
- Images download reliably to chosen folders
- Users have clear feedback on progress
- System handles errors gracefully
- Code is well-tested and documented

Welcome to Semantest! Let's build something amazing together! üöÄ
